ofxTraerPhysics 3.0.1
=====================
Adaption from libcinder version of Traer Physics to dependencies less openframeworks version.

Introduction
------------
Creates a easy to setup Particle System which can create particles and particle-to-particle forces. Original in Java but very popular for Processing, so many of you might used it with Processing.

Licence
-------
Licensed under the same "do whatever you want just email Jeff" license as the
Java/Processing version.

See http://murderandcreate.com/physics/ for the original Java code and examples.

See also https://github.com/bloomtime/CinderTraer for the c++ port this was based upon for cinder.

Installation
------------
Just drop the folder into the `openFrameworks/addons/` folder. Or git clone. After you have done that I've made it easier to just include the ofxTraerPhysics.h which includes all the necessary headers.

Dependencies
------------
none

Compatibility
------------
0.7.4

Known issues
------------
There seems to be an issue with Particle Attraction sometimes. They [particles] jiggle a bit to much.
