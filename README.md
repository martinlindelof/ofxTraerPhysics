ofxTraerPhysics
===============

## description ##
port of cinder traer physics, for openframeworks as standalone, no dependencies.
so this should work as other ofxAddons.

all credits goes to http://murderandcreate.com/physics/
and those who did the c++ cinder port of traer.

## known issues ##
seems ofVec3f might be behind some weird particle behaviours.
compared to cinder::Vec3.

## help wanted ##
if you're interested in having a traer physics port that has no
dependencies classes, please do a pull and help me fix it :)
